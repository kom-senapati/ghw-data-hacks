# Discord Chat Bot 💬🤖

This is a simple Discord bot created in Python that can be used for chatting purposes. Users can interact with the bot once it's invited to their Discord server.

## Setup 🛠️

### 1. Create a Discord App

First, you need to create a Discord application and add a bot user to it. Follow these steps:

- Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) 🌐
- Click on "New Application" and give your application a name.
- Navigate to the "Bot" tab and click "Add Bot" 🤖
- Copy the bot token generated for your bot.

### 2. Invite the Bot to Your Server

Now, invite your bot to your Discord server:

- Navigate to the "OAuth2" tab in your application settings.
- Under "OAuth2 URL Generator", select the "bot" scope.
- Copy the generated URL and open it in your browser 🌐
- Choose the server you want to invite the bot to and authorize.

### 3. Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project and add the following line:

```bash
DISCORD_TOKEN=YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN
```

Replace `YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` with the token you copied in step 1.

### 4. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. Then, install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Run the Bot

You're all set! You can now run the bot using the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

The bot should now be online and ready to chat in the Discord server you invited it to.

## Usage 🚀

Once the bot is running and connected to your server, users can interact with it using commands or through natural language processing, depending on its functionality.
